# Recon
Repo for my 2D Game "Recon" or "Project Recon." Details for the game below:

Intro To Recon:
Killerbean Unleashed inspired, Vector inspired
2D Side Scroller

Theme/Lore/Goal: 
Similar lore to Vector; an alien agency captures the Recon Experts (a group of 4 members) and confiscates all their powers. These powers are the only things that keep the Recon Experts alive (kinda like Iron Man’s center piece). You (the player) plays as the hero to rescue the Recon Experts by collecting all their powers, which are individually hidden behind lasers, cameras, barriers (obstacles) guarded by alien troops. You have 8 mins to do so. After collecting all the powers, you become the 5th member.
Stickman themed? Shadow Fight-like, Vector-like.

Functionalities:
Normal attack: Left click to shoot dual-wield pistols (standard weapon)
Movement: W A S D; W for jump, S for crouch (maybe), D move forwards, A move backwards
For each power you collect, you shapeshift/become one of the horsemen of that power. Therefore, you have the ability to toggle their power attack along with your normal attacks.
Can switch between each power/horseman based on the current amount of collected powers. C to toggle
Powers: (15 secs cooldown for each use)
Agent Herman - Camo ability (Scrapped)
Agent Omen - Clone ability (Thin Thruster)
Agent Raphael (Ralph) - Slow down time (Left/Right Thruster)
